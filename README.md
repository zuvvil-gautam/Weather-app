# Weather-app

<p>Here's my new project <b>Weather-app</b> where i can put down any location and it will show me the weather of that particular location.</p>

<p>so,how am i able to fetch the weather of a particular location, it's all because of an api,i logged in to https://openweathermap.org/ and from that website
  i used an api which fetches the current weather data of any city i provide on the search bar.</p>
